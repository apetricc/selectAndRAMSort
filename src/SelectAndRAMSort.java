/**
    12 points: In the main method, invoke all the methods you've implemented (described below) at least five times each
 on different inputs, for testing purposes.  Write all the inputs and the results into the console. This is the
 "testing" portion of your code.
 
     24 points: Define a method named countingSort. Implement Counting Sort as in the slides/textbook. One parameter
 will be the input array to sort. Another parameter will be a memory allocated array of the same length, for storing
 the output. The third parameter will be the largest single input value. You may write your code one-indexed or
 zero-indexed, but be aware the pseudocode one-indexes the input and output while zero-indexing the auxiliary array C.
    24 points: Define a method named randomizedQuickselect. Implement Randomized Quickselect as in the slides/textbook.
 One parameter is the input array.  Two more parameters are the inclusive bounds of the subarray to consider. One more
 parameter is i, the order statistic number to find the value of in the input array. This method must be nondestructive,
 meaning it does not reorder or modify the original input array! So, you will want to make a local copy of the input
 array using java.util.Arrays.copyOf, then use the local copy for everything. You will also need to reuse the same
 partition method from homework 4, which you used for quicksort.  If your partition method is not working properly,
 I strongly recommend you debug it and get it working correctly before moving on to the rest of this assignment.
    10 points extra credit: Define a method named radixSort, implementing a base-10 Radix Sort as in the
 slides/textbook. This will only be a few lines of code to define the radixSort method, but you will also need to
 create some private helper methods:
    A private helper method named getDigit to obtain and return the value of a single given base-10 digit's value
 from a given int value. For example, getDigit(1, 493) would return the value of the "1's place" in 493, which is
 the number 3. You can make that helper method a purely math function, or instead make it with String methods.
    A private helper method named countingSortOnDigit, which is a modified version of countingSort with an additional
 parameter indicating which base-10 digit is to be used for comparisons. (1 for rightmost digit, 2 for second digit
 from the right, etc.) Make sure your countingSort works properly before you make this new version.  The only
 difference will be the line(s) of code that directly compare two elements, which will invoke digitOf and use that
 single digit value, instead of comparing one entire input value with another.
    Do not use the Java Standard Library or other libraries, except you may use:

    console I/O
    the Java String class
            java.util.Arrays.toString
    java.util.Arrays.copyOf
    java.util.Arrays.copyOfRange
    java.util.Random class
            You must implement your methods described above from scratch. Do not copy a solution from any person or
 third party source, but you may use the pseudocode in the textbook and the course webpage. Design and write the code
 yourself. No partial credit on the extra credit; each extra credit problem must be fully correct to receive any extra
 credit.
